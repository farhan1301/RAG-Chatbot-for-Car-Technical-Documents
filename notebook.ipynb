You've been asked to experiment with integrating car manuals with an LLM to create a context-aware chatbot. They hope that this context-aware LLM can be hooked up to a text-to-speech software to read the model's response aloud.\n","\n","As a proof of concept, you'll integrate several pages from a car manual that contains car warning messages and their meanings and recommended actions. This particular manual, stored as an HTML file, `mg-zs-warning-messages.html`, is from an MG ZS, a compact SUV. Armed with your newfound knowledge of LLMs and LangChain, you'll implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create the context-aware chatbot.\n","\n","## Before you start\n","\n","In order to complete the project you will need to create a developer account with OpenAI and store your API key. Instructions for these steps are outlined below.\n","\n","### Create a developer account with OpenAI\n","\n","1. Go to the [API signup page](https://platform.openai.com/signup). \n","\n","2. Create your account (you'll need to provide your email address and your phone number).\n","\n","3. Go to the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). \n","\n","4. Create a new secret key.\n","\n","5. **Take a copy of it**. (If you lose it, delete the key and create a new one.)\n","\n","### Add a payment method\n","\n","OpenAI sometimes provides free credits for the API, but this can vary depending on geography. You may need to add debit/credit card details. \n","\n","**This project should cost less than 1 US cents with GPT-3.5-Turbo (but if you rerun tasks, you will be charged every time).**\n","\n","1. Go to the [Payment Methods page](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods).\n","\n","2. Click Add payment method.\n","\n","3. Fill in your card details.\n","\n","### Update to Python 3.10\n","\n","Due to how frequently the libraries required for this project are updated, you'll need to update your environment to Python 3.10:\n","\n","1. In the workbook, click on \"Environment,\" in the top toolbar and select \"Session details\".\n","\n","2. In the workbook language dropdown, select \"Python 3.10\".\n","\n","3. Click \"Confirm\" and hit \"Done\" once the session is ready."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":144,"id":"2acabac3-1319-441d-81b3-2e1a6f7f36ac","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":13,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true,"source_hidden":false},"lastExecutedAt":1722356612992,"lastExecutedByKernel":"6f1a331a-da0d-4487-ba0e-4130dd8e7deb","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Update your environment to Python 3.10 as described above before running this cell\nimport subprocess\nimport pkg_resources\n\ndef install_if_needed(package, version):\n    '''Function to ensure that the libraries used are consistent to avoid errors.'''\n    try:\n        pkg = pkg_resources.get_distribution(package)\n    except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:\n        subprocess.check_call([\"pip\", \"install\", f\"{package}=={version}\"])\n\ninstall_if_needed(\"langchain\", \"0.2.2\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"langchain-openai\", \"0.1.8\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"langchain-community\", \"0.2.3\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"unstructured\", \"0.14.4\")\ninstall_if_needed(\"chromadb\", \"0.5.0\")","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":425,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":290,"type":"stream"},"2":{"height":80,"type":"stream"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Update your environment to Python 3.10 as described above before running this cell\n","import subprocess\n","import pkg_resources\n","\n","def install_if_needed(package, version):\n","    '''Function to ensure that the libraries used are consistent to avoid errors.'''\n","    try:\n","        pkg = pkg_resources.get_distribution(package)\n","    except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:\n","        subprocess.check_call([\"pip\", \"install\", f\"{package}=={version}\"])\n","\n","install_if_needed(\"langchain\", \"0.2.2\")\n","install_if_needed(\"langchain-openai\", \"0.1.8\")\n","install_if_needed(\"langchain-community\", \"0.2.3\")\n","install_if_needed(\"unstructured\", \"0.14.4\")\n","install_if_needed(\"chromadb\", \"0.5.0\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":145,"id":"61baf413-6464-4c1c-a52d-b3764c124602","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":49,"lastExecutedAt":1722356613041,"lastExecutedByKernel":"6f1a331a-da0d-4487-ba0e-4130dd8e7deb","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Set your API key to a variable\nimport os\nopenai_api_key = os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n\n# Import the required packages\nimport langchain\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredHTMLLoader\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\nfrom langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredHTMLLoader"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Set your API key to a variable\n","import os\n","openai_api_key = os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n","\n","# Import the required packages\n","import langchain\n","from langchain import PromptTemplate\n","from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n","from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredHTMLLoader\n","from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n","from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough\n","from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n","from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\n","from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredHTMLLoader"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":146,"id":"bed58c70-1315-409c-a590-a4c7af3cad80","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":52,"lastExecutedAt":1722356613093,"lastExecutedByKernel":"6f1a331a-da0d-4487-ba0e-4130dd8e7deb","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Load the HTML as a LangChain document loader\nloader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader(file_path=\"data/mg-zs-warning-messages.html\")\ncar_docs = loader.load()"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Load the HTML as a LangChain document loader\n","loader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader(file_path=\"data/mg-zs-warning-messages.html\")\n","car_docs = loader.load()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":147,"id":"386a90c3-0ed4-4d3c-b98e-f36ef2ddbf18","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":52,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true,"source_hidden":false},"lastExecutedAt":1722356613145,"lastExecutedByKernel":"6f1a331a-da0d-4487-ba0e-4130dd8e7deb","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000,chunk_overlap=200)\n\nchunks = text_splitter.split_documents(car_docs)\nchunks"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["[Document(page_content='Warning Message Procedure Cruise Control Fault Indicates that the cruise control system has detected a fault.
